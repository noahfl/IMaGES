\title{Graphical Model 5-Dim Binary Example Data}
\description{
This data set contains a matrix containing information on five binary
variables (coded as 0/1) and the corresonding DAG model.

\format{
  The format is a list of two components

\details{
The data was generated using Tetrad in the following way. A random DAG
on five nodes was generated; binary variables were assigned to each
node; then conditional probability tables corresponding
to the structure of the generated DAG were constructed. Finally, 5000
samples were drawn using the conditional probability tables.
